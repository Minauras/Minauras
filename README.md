## Hi, I am Nara alias Minauras (pronouns: they/she)

I have an MSc in Electrical Engineering from EPFL Switzerland, and I am specialized in Embedded Systems and Computer Vision.

I am currently employed as an Electronics Engineer at [Oratek](https://oratek.com/).

### Projects
* The code from my 2021 Master's Thesis at [Idiap Research Institute](https://github.com/idiap) entitled [Deep Learning Methods For Digital Holography In An Embedded System](https://github.com/Minauras/deepdefresneling) has been published under the open source BSD-2 License.
* I worked at [Sigfox Paris](https://www.sigfox.com/en) in 2020, where my colleague [Nishant Nidaria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishantnidaria/) and I designed the electronics of a Sigfox connected bird nest. The project is called [Noeuf](https://noeuf.ml/) and you can see the demo video here:
